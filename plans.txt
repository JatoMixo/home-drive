==== OBJECTIVES ====
- Create a simple server to which you can upload files and download them later.
- Visualize simple files like .png or .txt

---- EXTRA ----
- Make a way of compressing the files stored in the "Drive Storagement" directory.
- Create a small file encryption algorithm for the local files or implement one like RSA or something like that.

==== PATHS ====

- /PATH/TO/DIRECTORY -> Show file explorer on the desired directory.
- /view/PATH/TO/FILE -> Show the contents of the file from the specified path.
- /download/PATH/TO/FILE/ -> Download on the client the directory or the file specified (Maybe implement the same for directories).
- Upload ones go here
